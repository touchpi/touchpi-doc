# Contributing to touchpi 

The maintainer and GitHub authorized contributor are developing touchpi.
But we are happy to add well and creative developed apps from anyone to this repository.

## Development workflow
We develop trunk based. 
This means that a branch is created from main and the changes come to main via a pull request. 
The pull request uses a review to check whether the code quality is good enough for the change. 
This means that the latest version in main is always ready for delivery. 
An automatic test and build pipeline is still under construction. 
A release summarizes various changes since the previous release. 
This procedure means that the release description does not describe the latest status in main. 
New deliverable commits since the last release may already be in main. 
These changes since the last release are usually visible as completed issues in the active milestone.
The next release is created as soon as all issues for the active milestone have been completed 
or moved to the next milestone. 
The last commit in main is tagged with the release version and a release version is created.

We actively welcome pull requests of app developers. 
If you're new, we encourage you to take a look at the discussion boards.
Have a look to [touchpi releases to public](https://github.com/touchpi/touchpi/discussions/5)
As an app developer, the repository should be forked to your own GitHub account. 
The developed app can then be transferred to the touchpi repository with a pull request to its main. 
It is advisable to announce and discuss this pull request in advance in the "show and tell" discussion area. 
In particular, changes to the requirements should be coordinated carefully.
Before a pull request, ensure your code quality is good with locally testings.
